I have also built a working demo of the product as project which revolves around the idea of the product.

## Comment Analytics for Youtube

In today's digital age, YouTube has become the go-to platform for content creators and marketers alike. With millions of videos uploaded every day, the content market is growing rapidly. As the competition on the platform intensifies, it becomes increasingly difficult for creators to gauge their audience's response and understand what they like or dislike about their content. The same goes for marketers, who need to understand their target audience to create effective campaigns.

For instance, imagine a content creator who has just launched a new video series. By using this product, they can quickly analyze the sentiment of the comments on their videos and understand how their audience is responding to their content. They can then make informed decisions on how to improve their videos to better meet their audience's preferences.

## Benefits
**This product can provide range of benefits the content creator, including :**

- Saves time and resources: Manual analysis of comments is time-consuming and resource-intensive. This tool automates the process, allowing content creators to focus on creating content.

- Enhances audience engagement: By tailoring content to their audience's interests, content creators can increase audience engagement and loyalty.

## Improvements that can be made in the product

-  This app is dependant on selenium to gather data, we can use Youtube API to fetch comments which can be feasible and also reduce latency
- NLP techniques to identify questions in the comments and show the genuine and frequent ones to the creator

That's it from my side, Hoping for a positive response to the octernship application. **Goodbye !**
